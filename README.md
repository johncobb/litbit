# LitBit
This C project demonstrates manipulating individual bits of an int32_t. These methods are convenient when desigining code for microcontrollers. Microcontrollers are typically configured by manipulating bitmasks which represent registers that control how the system operates.

#### compile
`gcc main.c`
### run
`./a.out`
